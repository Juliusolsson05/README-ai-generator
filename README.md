# README-ai-generator (Work in progress)
This application is supposed to generate a README file by only linking the project folder, this is supposed to happen by using AI to read trough all the source code and get a understanding of what is going on.

## How?
This application will be built as a python terminal command and will make it so that when you run a folder with the generate-readme command it will generate a readme file inside of that folder. The command will require you to enter the Open AI API code that this project will utalize.
